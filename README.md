### Hey human/humanoid ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesse Amamgbu. I am a data scientist with a mix of Backend Software Engineering and Devops. I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. With my wealth of knowledge in software engineering and data science, I develop and create data driven solutions which has helped numerous businesses. 


When I'm not coding, I am either binge watching Animes, blogging or sight-seeing with friends. I believe in creating new memories and love exciting challenges.



NB: I am a Python evangelist. No slander of python is welcome. Lol
