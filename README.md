### Hey human/humanoid ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesse Amamgbu. I am a Data scientist and Backend/Devops Engineer. I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. I help businesses develop and scale data driven solutions.

Apart from coding, I also maintain a blog - you can find my articles on my blog at [https://amamgbu.hashnode.dev](https://amamgbu.hashnode.dev).

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me by mail at amamgbujesse@yahoo.com




âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I am either binge watching Animes, blogging or sight-seeing with friends. I also mentor younger data scientists in my local community on how to get started in Data Science.
